4. This is a first order mode for the half wave ridge wave. We know that this is a first order
mode as the wave centers around the middle of the waveguide

5. The surf mode shows the magnitude of the modes within the the waveguide to make it easier to visualize.
However, I feel that this is counter plot displays the information better. 

6b. As the ridge width increases, it was noticed that the neff increases. Additionally, the contour rings showing 
frequency becomes more circular as the large width reduces the reflections from the waveguide that would cause the 
weird shape

c. As the mesh density decreased by 8, it was noticed that the contour lines became more seperated. This indicates,
that the sample between frequencies increases resulting in a less accurate systems

7. As the core increases, the so called circle goes up. As the index increases, the modes properages upwards as the 
average is going to be more accurate.
