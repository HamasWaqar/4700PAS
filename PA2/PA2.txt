Inclusion: Gradient/medium

Q3b. 
A wave going through a medium

Q3ci. 
The code for inclusion is...

%epi{1} = ones(nx{1},ny{1})*c_eps_0; % Inclusion
%epi{1}(125:150,55:95)= c_eps_0*11.3; % Inclusion

when commenting could, the gradient dispears so the wave
travels through the medium with mininal reflection (depends
on the medium) and defraction. 

Q3cii.
bc structure is used as a boundary condation for the medium. 
This structure is part of the Yee2DEM functions that defines
the structure and properties of the yee cell. 


Q3ciii.
bc{1}.s(1) defines the source for the wave in the medium

Q3ciV.
bc{1}.xm.type = 'a';
bc{1}.xp.type = 'a';
bc{1}.ym.type = 'a';
bc{1}.yp.type = 'a';

defines the edges of the medium. 

bc1.xp.type defines the the interaction of the wavegiude at the edges of the medium
'a' makes the medium edge a PML (Perfectly Match Layer) that absorbs the waves
'e' makes the medium edge acts like a mirror reflects the wave



Q4b.
st determines the decays of the graph
